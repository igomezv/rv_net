# rv_net


## Steps
1. Download all the files from this repository
2. navigate to the rv_net folder in your terminal. Then, replicate the anaconda environment by typing the following in a command prompt
<code> conda env create -f tensorflow_env.yml </code>
3. Run the <code>2_3_1_HARPS_Linear_FC_CNN_June10_2023.ipynb</code>  script


## Modifications for making .yml files to work on Other computers
1. Create the .yml file without builds
   <code>conda env export --no-builds > my_environment.yml</code>
2. In addition, this may not work on Windows devices. There does not seem to be an easy way to automatically remove OS-specific packages, but there is a way to see which packages were specifically installed using <code>conda install</code> so we could use that to remove all other packages from the .yml file.
   <code>conda env export --from-history</code>
